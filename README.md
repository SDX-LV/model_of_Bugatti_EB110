# model_of_Bugatti_EB110
Bugatti EB110 (open source 3D mesh and physics model of a car)

The goal of this project is to release all source files (Blender 2.8+ files, textures, audio and documentation) as open source content (under Apache 2.0 license). It should be easy for anyone to render, use or port this model to any game or simulator (free or commercial) so that there are more virtual EB110s for us to enjoy.
The initial target platform for this model is Assetto Corsa and corresponding initial alpha release was originally posted at https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/bugatti-eb110-gt.35178/ You can find more details about the current state of the project by following the link.


Note: this repository only holds original content created as art inspired by a product of a defunct company Bugatti Automobili S.p.A. (1987â€“1995). Any possible use of trademarks or proprietary content is for artistic effect only.

Note2: If you would like to use or develop further this open source project - consider contacting one of the recent contributors for more details. Besides the files available on GitHub there are additional supporting materials and just tips that can help you with development. We are happy to help anyone bring EB110 to more places or make this model better.
