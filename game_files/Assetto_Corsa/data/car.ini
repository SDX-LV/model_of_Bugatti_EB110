; "try around" values, should be calculated:
GRAPHICS_OFFSET=0.0,-0.388,0.327	; 3 axis correction (x,y,z), applies only to the 3D object of the car. in meters
; moves the 3D model relative to the centre of gravity (body Left, body UP, body FORWARD)
; try around till it fits or just calculate the number based on CoG and positioning inside the 3D model

GRAPHICS_PITCH_ROTATION=-0.11		; changes 3D object rotation in pitch
TOTALMASS=1780 						; total vehicle weight in kg with driver and no fuel
INERTIA=1.94,1.114,4.40 			; car polar inertia. Calculated from the car dimensions. Just enter the generic width,height,

[CONTROLS]
FFMULT=1.45						; Force Feedback power multiplayer
STEER_ASSIST=1.000				; Variable steer assist, speed relative
STEER_LOCK=495					; Real car's steer lock from center to right
STEER_RATIO=17.32				; Steer ratio
LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO=0.0021 	; Because of AC complex suspension geometry, you need to calculate manually the steer rod ratio
; Enter AC in dev app mode enabled
; Open SUSPENSIONS app
; turn your steering wheel by 90 degrees
; check the actual steer ratio value
; modify LINEAR_STEER_ROD_RATIO value until ingame steer ratio and car.ini STEER_RATIO values are similar

[FUEL]

[RULES]
MIN_HEIGHT=0.060   				; meters minimum height rule front/rear (If your setup of the car, goes under that minimum height, then the Drive button will be disabled after a short 5 seconds check. You can also set this to 0.0 and for no ruling.)
